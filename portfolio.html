						<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>
						<img src="assets/images/engineer.jpg">
						<p>There once was an Electrical Engineer.  This particular engineer enjoyed what he was doing - planning, designing and building. Well, kind of.</p>
						<p>The peculiar thing is, he always had an itch.  If you asked him he could never explain fully explain it. "All I know," he would say, "is that I want to do something else. Something: <em>hands-on, faster-paced and exciting."</em></p>
					</div>

					<div class="column">
						<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>
						
						<p>This engineer then remembered that once upon a time, before electrical engineering, he wanted to be something else - <em>A programmer.</em></p> 
						
						<p>With this revelation in hand, he started to look for ways to make it happen. One month later, as quick as can be, he was back in school!</p>

						<p>Now armed with workable knowledge of several technologies, our engineer set out to tackle the web development world.</p>

						<p>He even took a job as a teachers assistant, to help others who had an itch just like him.</p>
